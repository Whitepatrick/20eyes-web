apache2 server up and running on stage.20eyes with a previous blog I am going to repurpose for this project.

still have to lock things up around the config files for apache server.

20eyes.org is live on both stage and production apache servers. both are tied to the github account.

Had to adjust both godaddy name server settings as well as setting up records for the rackspace server (A, AAAA, CNAME)

Finally got subfolders to not show contents to anyone who happens to figure out the web file structure on the prod server. Simple adjustment to the httpd.conf file in /etc/apache2.
