<h1>Work In Progress</h1>

<h2>CURRENT: MongoDB + PHP</h2>

<p>After looking over several different login scripts for MongoDB
in PHP I finally started developing one of my own to be custom fit
to 20eyes.org unique infrastructure. After watching some of the logs
while sending some DB traffic to the server I'm VERY excited about
what I saw. Will have this problem fixed in the next day or so.</p>


<h2>Past:</h2>

<h3>Back end work</h3>

<p>Now working on a feature for the site that will allow
the user to create an account, upload an image, and submit a
comment with the image. All managed by mongodb, scripted
with php. It will be a new git branch to be merged after testing.</p>

<h3> Site Creation</h3>

<p>Now creating all pages and setting up working links. By the end of tonight (January 24th) I would like to have a bare bones site to accomodate forthcoming content that will document my contiuous deployment project. Very Excited!</p>
