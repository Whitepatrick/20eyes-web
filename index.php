<h3>Exporation into the World of Contiuous Deployment</h3>

<p>This site is contains all information and documentation on my independent study project during my last semester at Virginia Commonwealth University. My goal is to create a continuous deployment environment between 2 nodes. Along the way I hope to enhance my knowledge of front and backend web technologies. I offer this page up to prospective employers as a window to things I have learned in past job experiences, as well as knowledge gained while studying at VCU.</p>
