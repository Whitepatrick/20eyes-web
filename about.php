<h3>
  I live in Brooklyn, NY with my partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/liannawoods", target="_blank">Lianna</a> and our cat. I'm a software test engineer working for a medium sized content delivery company based in Washington, DC. I grew
up in Maryland, and lived in DC until 2010 when I moved to Richmond, VA, then moved back to DC in 2014, and off to Brooklyn in 2015. I hate moving!
</h3>
<h3>
  I love building and maintaining test infrastructure and automating as much possible.
</h3>
<h3>
  My interests include but are not limited to Linux, Ruby, reading product reviews on
  Amazon, and basketball.
</h3>
<h3>
  In another life I worked in supply chain management or logistics.
